# Pomodoro Timer in Python with Tkinter

This Python project provides a visual Pomodoro timer using the Tkinter library to help you implement the Pomodoro Technique for improved focus and productivity.

## Features:

* Customizable timers: Set work and break durations to suit your needs. (Default: 25 minutes work, 5 minutes break)
* Visual countdown timer: Track the remaining time for both work and break periods in a user-friendly interface.


## Benefits:

* Enhance focus and concentration by working in focused bursts.
* Reduce procrastination and maintain momentum on your tasks.
* Improve productivity by optimizing work and break cycles.

## Prerequisites:

Python 3.x (Download from https://www.python.org/downloads/)

`tkinter` library (included with Python)

## Using the Pomodoro Timer:

Enter your desired work and break durations (in minutes) in the designated entry fields.

Click the "Start" button to begin the work session.

The timer will count down visually, keeping you informed of the remaining time.

When the work session ends, the timer will automatically switch to the break period.

## Customization:

Modify the default work and break durations in the code (look for variables like work_minutes and break_minutes).

Consider adding features like progress bars or color changes to depict time remaining.

## Running the program:
* Clone this repository
* Navigate to the project directory
* Run the script in your terminal `python main.py`
